# My project's README

Project can be run usig php builtin serve usig./server.sh 

Test can be run usig ./tests.sh - They won't run under provided vagrant environment because 
when usig cli command it sees only local mysql (vagrant works for www)

I did not follow (on purpose) naming convensions in one case: i used db naming convention for setting model attriubutes
